# Deepspeed-simple-implementation
Aims to build a simple example model and find out the training loss and know how efficiently deepspeed technique trains the model

#Installing PyTorch Ligthning
Before running the code, Pytorch Lightning must be installed

simple command in shell:
$ pip install pytorch-lightning

Here our code aims to find the training loss and helps us understand how efficienty our model is trained.
